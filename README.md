## Description
This is the repository for the paper [*UniteD-SRL: A unified dataset for span- and dependency-based multilingual and cross-lingual Semantic Role Labeling*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354550985_UniteD-SRL_A_Unified_Dataset_for_Span-and_Dependency-Based_Multilingual_and_Cross-Lingual_Semantic_Role_Labeling),
to be presented at EMNLP 2021 by [Rocco Tripodi](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/rocco.tripodi), [Simone Conia](https://c-simone.github.io) and [Roberto Navigli](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/navigli/).


## Abstract
> Multilingual and cross-lingual Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) have recently garnered increasing attention as multilingual text representation techniques have become more effective and widely available. While recent work has attained growing success, results on gold multilingual benchmarks are still not easily comparable across languages, making it difficult to grasp where we stand. For example, in CoNLL-2009, the standard benchmark for multilingual SRL, language-to-language comparisons are affected by the fact that each language has its own dataset which differs from the others in size, domains, sets of labels and annotation guidelines. In this paper, we address this issue and propose UNITED-SRL, a new benchmark for multilingual and cross-lingual, span-and dependency-based SRL. UNITED-SRL provides expert-curated parallel annotations using a common predicate-argument structure inventory, allowing direct comparisons across languages and encouraging studies on cross-lingual transfer in SRL.

### Get the data
The latest version of UniteD-SRL is freely available for research purposes at https://nlp.uniroma1.it/resources. A request may take a few days to process: feel free to contact us if you experience any problems.

### Data format
The data is available in a format that is very similar to the [CoNLL-U format](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html).
Here is an example:
```
# document_id = 1996/a/50/18_supp
# sentence_id = _574:1
# text = The Committee insists that all perpetrators of violations of the Convention be brought to justice.
0 The            the            _                    B-agent _

```
* **Column 1:** token index in the sentence.
* **Column 2:** tokens in the sentence.
* **Column 3:** lemma of each token in the sentence.
* **Column 4:** VerbAtlas frame of a predicate. If the token is not a predicate, then `_`.
* **Column 4 + i:** Roles of predicate `i`. E.g. Column 5 lists the roles for the first predicate, i.e., `insists`.
